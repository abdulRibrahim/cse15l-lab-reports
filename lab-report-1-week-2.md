# [VScode]
The first step in logging into a course-specific account on ieng6 is to install VScode.
You can find the website for VScode here(https://code.visualstudio.com/). Since I am on Windows, I downloaded the Windows version from the dropdown menu. Find the appropriate version for your computer and follow the instructions to complete installation.
